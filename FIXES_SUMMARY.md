# Speech-to-Text Debugging - Fixes Applied

## Summary

I've debugged and fixed the speech-to-text (STT) implementation in your grant assistant application. Here's what was wrong and what I fixed.

## Problems Found

### 1. ❌ **Wrong API Endpoint**
- **Issue:** Code was using an incorrect endpoint format
- **Location:** `src/services/eventlabs.ts` line ~80
- **Problem:** Endpoint was `/speech-to-text` instead of `/v1/speech-to-text`

### 2. ❌ **Wrong Authentication Header**
- **Issue:** Using `Authorization: Bearer` instead of ElevenLabs' required format
- **Problem:** ElevenLabs uses `xi-api-key` header, not the standard Authorization header

### 3. ❌ **Wrong Form Data Parameter**
- **Issue:** Form data field was `audio` instead of `file`
- **Problem:** ElevenLabs API expects the field name to be `file`

### 4. ❌ **No Debug Logging**
- **Issue:** No visibility into what was happening during STT conversion
- **Problem:** Impossible to diagnose issues when they occurred

### 5. ❌ **Missing Environment Variables**
- **Issue:** No `.env` file or `.env.example` template
- **Problem:** Users didn't know how to configure the API credentials

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Fixed API Endpoint
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
const response = await fetch(`${this.config.endpoint}/speech-to-text`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.config.apiKey}` }
});

// AFTER (CORRECT)
const sttEndpoint = `${this.config.endpoint}/v1/speech-to-text`;
const response = await fetch(sttEndpoint, {
  headers: { 'xi-api-key': this.config.apiKey }
});
```

### ✅ 2. Fixed Form Data
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
formData.append('audio', audioBlob, 'recording.webm');

// AFTER (CORRECT)
formData.append('file', audioBlob, 'recording.webm');
```

### ✅ 3. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging
Now logs:
- Service initialization
- API key presence
- Endpoint configuration
- Audio blob size
- API request URL
- Response status
- Full response data
- Transcribed text
- All errors with context

### ✅ 4. Created Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.example` with template
- Created `.env` file for user to edit
- Added instructions in README.md

### ✅ 5. Improved Error Handling
- Validates credentials before API calls
- Better error messages
- Handles empty transcripts gracefully

## Files Modified

1. **`src/services/eventlabs.ts`** - Fixed STT implementation, added debug logging
2. **`.env.example`** - Created template for API configuration
3. **`.env`** - Created (user needs to add their API key)
4. **`README.md`** - Added setup and debugging instructions
5. **`DEBUG_STT.md`** - Created debugging guide

## How to Use

### Step 1: Add Your API Key
1. Open the `.env` file
2. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual ElevenLabs API key
3. Get your key from: https://elevenlabs.io/

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop the server if running (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for initialization logs:
   ```
   🔧 EventLabs Service initialized
   🔧 API Key exists: true
   🔧 Endpoint: https://api.elevenlabs.io
   ```
3. Click "Hold to Speak" button
4. Speak into microphone
5. Click "Stop Recording"
6. Watch console for:
   ```
   ✅ STT Response: {...}
   📝 Transcription: [your spoken words]
   ```

## Debugging Console Output

### ✅ Success Look Like This:
```
🔧 EventLabs Service initialized
🔧 API Key exists: true
🔧 Endpoint: https://api.elevenlabs.io
🎤 Recording started
🎤 Recording stopped, size: 45823 bytes
🔍 Starting STT conversion...
🔍 Audio blob size: 45823 bytes
🔍 API Key: Set
🔍 Endpoint: https://api.elevenlabs.io
🔍 Sending to: https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text
🔍 Response status: 200
✅ STT Response: {text: "your transcribed text here"}
📝 Transcription: your transcribed text here
```

### ❌ Common Errors and Fixes:

**Error: ⚠️ Missing environment variables**
- Fix: Add your API key to `.env` file

**Error: ❌ STT Error Response: 401**
- Fix: Your API key is invalid. Get a new one from ElevenLabs

**Error: ❌ STT Error Response: 404**
- Fix: Endpoint URL is wrong. Should be exactly `https://api.elevenlabs.io`

**Error: ❌ Empty transcript received**
- Fix: Audio quality too poor. Speak louder/closer to mic

## What's Next?

1. **Get your ElevenLabs API key** (free tier available)
2. **Add it to `.env` file**
3. **Restart the dev server**
4. **Test the voice input**
5. **Check the browser console for the debug logs**

If you still have issues after following these steps, check the console output and let me know what you see!
